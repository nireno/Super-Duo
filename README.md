# Super-Duo
Project 3 from Udacity's Android Nanodegree course focusing on UX, accessibility and working with an existing codebase.

Application Improvements:
Added a home screen widget, giving users instant access to a live list of football scores.
Improved existing app UX with better support for right-to-left languages and TalkBack (for the hearing impaired)
